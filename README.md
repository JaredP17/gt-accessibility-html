# Horiseon Website (Accessibility Refactor)

## Description 
This is my fix for the Horiseon website. This fix is designed to meet the criteria of the GT Full-Stack Flex program homework assignment by adding semantic improvements and minimizing CSS redundancies. 

Check out the new and improved site [here](https://jaredp17.github.io/gt-accessibility-html/).
